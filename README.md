# War: Age of Empire!

War, a classic card game I played growing up.  War  is only a game for 2 players, and the card values rank from Ace (highest) to 2 (lowest), a winner is determined by the opponent running out of cards.  Click the start button to play and before the game begins, each player is dealt 26 cards.  Each player flips over 1 card and then they are compared, the highest card wins. If both the player and the computer flip their card over and they are identical, this initates WAR!  Each player needs to draw 4 cards from their hand and flipping over the 4th card, cards are compared and highest card takes the whole pile.  If on the 4th card, both the computer and player flip over the same card again, you initate war again.  If at any point, the player or computer runs out of cards in their hand, they will take the cards from their win pile, shuffle and use those cards.

Background on the Age of Empire theme, it was a strategy game that I played around the same time I played War.  I thought it was a fitting game theme.
